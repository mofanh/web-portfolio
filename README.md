# Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to Ade-mir for their excellent tutorial on building a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was inspired by and incorporates concepts from their work, which can be found at:

- [HTML, CSS & JS Portfolio Tutorial 2](https://github.com/Ade-mir/html-css-js-portfolio-tutorial-2)

I have used this tutorial as a starting point and have made modifications to suit my needs. The original tutorial is a great resource for anyone looking to learn the basics of web development.

Thank you, Ade-mir, for sharing your knowledge and expertise with the community!
